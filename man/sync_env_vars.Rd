\title{Sync Environment Variables from .Renviron to Current Session}
\usage{
sync_env_vars(var_names, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{var_names}{Character vector of environment variable names to sync. These should
be the names of the variables that you want to be updated from the .Renviron file.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; whether to display status messages and current values.
Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL.
}
\description{
Makes the environment variables in the current R session match exactly what's in the
.Renviron file. This function ensures consistency between the persistent environment
configuration and the active R session.
}
\details{
This function is essential when making changes to the .Renviron file during an R session,
as changes to this file are normally only loaded when R starts. It's typically called
after using \code{write_vars_to_renviron()} to make the newly written variables immediately
available without restarting R.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After writing variables to .Renviron, sync them to the current session
write_vars_to_renviron(
  var_list = list(MY_PACKAGE_DIR = "/path/to/data"),
  package = "mypackage"
)
sync_env_vars("MY_PACKAGE_DIR")

# Get environment variable list from a package's YAML config and sync all
pkg_vars <- get_env_var_names(package = "mypackage")
sync_env_vars(pkg_vars)

# Sync without printing status messages
sync_env_vars(c("MY_PACKAGE_DIR", "MY_PACKAGE_CONFIG"), verbose = FALSE)
}
